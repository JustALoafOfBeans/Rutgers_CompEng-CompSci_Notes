# Rutgers_CompEng-ComSci_Notes
A condensed set of notes for all the calculation based classes I've taken while on a Computer Engineering and Computer Science double major track at Rutgers University. While these notes cover virtually all equations necessary for their respective class, they are not meant to be a substitue for attending lecture or doing homework, they are merely for study purposes only and unapproved usage on exams and assignments is heavily discouraged. 

All that being said, I have decided to release these notes to support fellow students in the pursuit of higher education and help make studying just a little bit easier. Best of luck to everyone! :)
